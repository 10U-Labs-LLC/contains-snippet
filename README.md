# contains-snippet

A command-line tool that checks whether a given snippet exists anywhere within a file. For plain text files, it searches the raw content directly. For certain filetypes that support structured content (such as source code files), it can optionally check a commented rendering of the file, allowing you to search for snippets within comments and documentation blocks rather than just the literal text.
